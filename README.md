#Handy: Gesture Recognition Program

Handy is a Python-based gesture recognition program built using OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. It provides real-time hand gesture recognition and tracking capabilities, allowing developers to incorporate gesture-based interactions into their applications or projects.

Features
Real-time hand tracking: Handy leverages the power of MediaPipe's hand tracking module to accurately detect and track hand movements in real-time.
Gesture recognition: It recognizes a set of predefined hand gestures, enabling developers to trigger specific actions based on recognized gestures.
Customizable gestures: Developers can easily define and train their own gestures by capturing hand pose data and associating them with specific actions.
Easy integration: Handy provides a simple and intuitive API, making it straightforward to integrate gesture recognition functionality into existing Python applications or projects.
Prerequisites
To run Handy on your system, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.8.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe
You can install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe

Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up and run Handy on your local machine:

Clone the Handy repository from GitHub:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handy.git

Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code
cd handy

Run the handy.py script:

Copy code
python handy.py
This will launch the Handy application and start detecting and recognizing hand gestures.

Customize gestures (optional):

If you want to define and train your own gestures, you can modify the gestures.py file. This file contains the predefined gestures and associated actions. You can add, remove, or modify gestures as per your requirements.

Usage
Once the Handy program is running, you can perform various hand gestures to trigger actions. By default, Handy recognizes a set of predefined gestures, but you can extend or modify them based on your needs.

The recognized gestures can be used to control other applications or perform specific actions within your project. You can define the desired actions for each recognized gesture by modifying the gestures.py file.
