Handy: Gesture Recognition Program

Handy is a Python-based gesture recognition program built using OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. It provides real-time hand gesture recognition and tracking capabilities, allowing developers to incorporate gesture-based interactions into their applications or projects.

Features
Real-time hand tracking: Handy leverages the power of MediaPipe's hand tracking module to accurately detect and track hand movements in real-time.
Gesture recognition: It recognizes a set of predefined hand gestures, enabling developers to trigger specific actions based on recognized gestures.
Customizable gestures: Developers can easily define and train their own gestures by capturing hand pose data and associating them with specific actions.
Easy integration: Handy provides a simple and intuitive API, making it straightforward to integrate gesture recognition functionality into existing Python applications or projects.
